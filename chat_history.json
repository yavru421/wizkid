Specifically, I can perform actions such as:\n\n* Web search: I can search the web in real-time to provide users with the most up-to-date information.\n* Code execution: I can execute code to help users with tasks such as debugging, code generation, and technical problem-solving.\n\nThese capabilities are made possible by my underlying technology, which combines multiple openly available models with built-in tool use, starting with web search and code execution. This allows me to handle real-world queries in a single high-performance, low-cost API call.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly, I do have the ability to perform certain actions for the user, and I'm here to help with any tasks or questions you may have!"

Here is the prompt:\n\n\"Update my code files to reflect the following changes:\n\n1. Set the default mode to assume the user is tech-illiterate and provide step-by-step instructions.\n2. Use simple language and avoid technical jargon.\n3. Anticipate common challenges and provide guidance on how to overcome them.\n4. Provide troubleshooting tips and suggestions for common issues.\n5. Leverage the Groq API's tool use feature to enable real-time information access and dynamic interaction with external environments.\n6. Implement the `reasoning_effort` parameter to allow for quick responses or disable reasoning.\n7. Use the Groq API's batch processing feature to handle large-scale tasks.\n\nTo implement these features, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Set up the Groq API with the official Llama API by following the instructions on the Groq website.\n2. Use the Groq API's chat completion endpoint to create a model response for a given chat conversation. This can be done by sending a POST request to the `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with the conversation history and model ID.\n3. Implement the Groq API's file upload and download features by using the `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/files` endpoint.\n\nPlease ensure that the code changes are compatible with the latest Groq API updates, including the Llama Guard 4-12B model and the `exclude_domains` and `include_domains` parameters for web search.\n\nAdditionally, please consider the following Groq API updates and features:\n\n* The `reasoning_effort` parameter can be used to control the level of reasoning in the model responses.\n* The `exclude_domains` and `include_domains` parameters can be used to filter web search results.\n* The Groq API's batch processing feature can be used to handle large-scale tasks.\n* The Groq API's tool use feature can be used to enable real-time information access and dynamic interaction with external environments.\n\nPlease provide a detailed explanation of the changes and any necessary code snippets.\n\nNote: Please make sure to check the Groq API documentation for the latest updates and features before implementing the changes.\"\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Set up the Groq API with the official Llama API\ngroq_api_key = \"YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY\"\nllama_model_id = \"YOUR_LLAAMA_MODEL_ID\"\n\n# Use the Groq API's chat completion endpoint\ndef get_model_response(conversation_history):\n    url = \"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions\"\n    headers = {\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {groq_api_key}\",\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n    }\n    data = {\n        \"model\": llama_model_id,\n        \"messages\": conversation_history\n    }\n    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)\n    return response.json()\n\n# Implement the Groq API's file upload and download features\ndef upload_file(file_path):\n    url = \"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/files\"\n    headers = {\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {groq_api_key}\",\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/octet-stream\"\n    }\n    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as file:\n        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=file)\n    return response.json()\n\ndef download_file(file_id):\n    url = f\"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/files/{file_id}\"\n    headers = {\n        \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {groq_api_key}\",\n        \"Content-Type\": \"application/octet-stream\"\n    }\n    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n    return response.content\n```\n\nThis prompt includes instructions on how to implement the features correctly, as well as code snippets to demonstrate the implementation. It also considers the latest Groq API updates and features, including the `reasoning_effort` parameter, `exclude_domains` and `include_domains` parameters, batch processing, and tool use."
