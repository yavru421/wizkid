# WizKid - Issue Resolution Summary

## PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

### 1. API Key Issue (MAJOR)
**Problem**: System environment variable `GROQ_API_KEY` was set with an invalid/expired key, taking precedence over the valid key in `.env` file.
**Solution**: Added `$env:GROQ_API_KEY = $null` at startup to clear system env var and force loading from `.env` file.
**Result**: Chat API calls now work correctly.

### 2. File Encoding Issues (MAJOR)
**Problem**: Special Unicode characters (emojis) in the main script were corrupted, causing PowerShell parser errors.
**Solution**: Replaced all special characters with plain text equivalents (e.g., "ðŸ“¸" â†’ "Screenshot").
**Result**: Script now parses and executes without syntax errors.

### 3. Module Loading Order (MINOR)
**Problem**: ApiKeyManager.psm1 had corrupted special characters causing import failures.
**Solution**: Recreated the module file with proper encoding and fixed Get-GroqApiKey to read from .env file.
**Result**: All modules now load correctly.

### 4. Chat System Functionality (FIXED)
**Problem**: Chat messages weren't appearing in UI, event handlers weren't firing.
**Solution**: 
- Fixed ObservableCollection binding in chat system
- Simplified event handlers 
- Added proper error handling and UI state management
- Ensured ItemsSource is correctly bound to chatMessages collection
**Result**: Chat now works - messages appear in UI, API calls succeed, responses display correctly.

### 5. Screenshot Functionality (WORKING)
**Problem**: Screenshot feature was broken due to encoding issues and missing error handling.
**Solution**: Simplified screenshot handler, added proper status messages, fixed window minimize/restore logic.
**Result**: Screenshot function now works and provides user feedback.
